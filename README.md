## Overview

This is a web application of an e-shop that sells technology products such as smartphones, laptops and televisions. It was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. It was one of the first projects that i made that helped me understand how to make a web application that needs a database.

## Prerequisites

If someone wants to run the web application, needs to download XAMPP from the link: 
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

And install (execute file .exe) to the path C:\xampp
And needs to open xampp-control.exe that is found at the address C:\xampp
There, he needs to run MySQL and Apache

Then, he needs to have the folder my_files that includes source files (files .html, .css, .js, .php) and some images, at the address C:\xampp\htdocs.
Finally, he needs to open a browser (e.g. Google Chrome) and execute the php file with the localhost link : http://localhost/my_files/home_page.html

And will see the home page :
![Home page](images/home_page.png?raw=true "Home page")
